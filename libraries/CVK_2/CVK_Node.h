/**
 * @brief Class for Nodes in the scene graph.
 * 
 * A Node in the scene graph represents the hierarchical structure
 * of the scene. One node consists of a list of subnodes, representing
 * all children of this node. It consists of a 4x4 model matrix, for 
 * the current localization, rotation and scale of the represented
 * object and all children. 
 * 
 * Furthermore a node may have a connection to a geometry, which can
 * be rendered and a material, which can be used while rendering by
 * the current shader. Additionally a node may have a name, which can
 * be used to search this specific node in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * When a node is created, standard values for all members are set,
 * which can be set manually later. An example creation of a node is:
 * CVK::Node node();
 * node.setGeometry( geometry);
 * node.setMaterial( material);
 * scene.addChild( &node);
 * 
 * Another way to create a node is to load a scene with ASSIMP. This
 * is done by using the path of the file, which has to be loaded. The
 * loaded scene is then represented in this node and its child nodes. An 
 * example for this is:
 * CVK::Node* scene = new CVK::Node("Scene", "/pathToFile.obj");
 * 
 * While rendering the scene, the current node accumulates the model
 * matrix to the current model matrix and sends it to the bound shader.
 * Also a shader update is called with this node. If the node has a
 * geometry, then it is rendered. At the end the render function is 
 * called in every child, with a copy of the current accumulated model 
 * matrix. An example of rendering the scene is:
 * scene->render();
